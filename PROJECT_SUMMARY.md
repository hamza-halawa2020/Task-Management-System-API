- Detailed table descriptions and relationships
- Business rules and constraints documentation

### 4. Documentation
- `README.md` with comprehensive setup and usage instructions
- API endpoint documentation
- Authentication and authorization details

## Architecture Overview

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and role management
- **Tasks**: Core task entity with status tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: Many-to-many relationship for task dependencies
- **Personal Access Tokens**: Sanctum authentication tokens

### API Structure
```
/api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ login                    # POST - User authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logout                   # POST - User logout
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ me                       # GET - Current user info
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks                    # GET, POST - Task management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/{id}               # GET, PUT, DELETE - Individual task operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-dependencies        # POST - Add task dependency
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/{id}/dependencies  # GET - Get task dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task-dependencies/{id}   # DELETE - Remove dependency
```

### Security Features
- CSRF protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via Eloquent ORM
- Role-based access control
- Secure token-based authentication

## Testing

### Sample Data Included
- **2 Managers**: manager1@example.com, manager2@example.com
- **3 Users**: user1@example.com, user2@example.com, user3@example.com
- **6 Sample Tasks**: Various statuses and assignments
- **Task Dependencies**: Demonstrating the dependency system

### Test Credentials
- **Password**: `password` (for all users)
- **Manager Token**: Login as manager1@example.com
- **User Token**: Login as user1@example.com

## üê≥ Containerization

### Docker Setup
- **PHP-FPM**: PHP 8.2 with required extensions
- **Nginx**: Web server configuration
- **MySQL**: Database server
- **phpMyAdmin**: Database management interface

### Quick Start with Docker
```bash
docker-compose up -d
# Access API at http://localhost:8000
# Access phpMyAdmin at http://localhost:8080
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Task Management
- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Status tracking (pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- Due date management
- User assignment

### 2. Dependency System
- Add/remove task dependencies
- Circular dependency prevention
- Dependency completion validation
- Visual dependency tracking

### 3. Filtering & Search
- Filter by status
- Filter by assigned user
- Filter by due date range
- Combined filtering support

### 4. Role-based Permissions
- Manager: Full task management capabilities
- User: Limited to assigned tasks and status updates
- Secure API endpoint protection

### 5. Data Validation
- Comprehensive input validation
- Business rule enforcement
- Error message standardization
- Type safety and constraints

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 12.x
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum
- **Database**: SQLite (default) / MySQL
- **API**: RESTful JSON API
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Testing**: Postman Collection
- **Documentation**: Markdown

## Business Logic Implementation

### Task Dependencies
- Tasks cannot be completed until all dependencies are completed
- Circular dependencies are prevented at the database and application level
- Dependency management is restricted to managers only

### Status Management
- Users can only update status of tasks assigned to them
- Managers can update all task fields
- Status changes are validated against business rules

### Access Control
- Token-based authentication for all API endpoints
- Role-based authorization for different operations
- Secure data access based on user permissions

## Performance Considerations

- Database indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- Eager loading of relationships to prevent N+1 queries
- Efficient filtering and pagination support
- Optimized database queries using Eloquent ORM

## Security Implementation

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Secure authentication tokens
- Role-based access control
- Data access restrictions

## Additional Features

- Comprehensive error handling
- Consistent API response format
- Detailed logging and debugging
- Docker containerization
- Complete documentation
- Postman testing suite
- Database ERD visualization
